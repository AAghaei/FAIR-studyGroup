# Follow-up events to the ["FAIR Data and Software"-workshop](https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/) at [TIB, Hannover](https://www.tib.eu)

We meet every **Wednesday** at **16 to 18 o'clock** in the
[**Grunwald-Haus**, ground floor, right besides the entrance](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27870998)
(you may need to knock on the window). We'll be learning from each other and teaching ourselves about:

- the [FAIR Data Principles]
- sustainable software development
- in the context of scientific research, and
- establish a local [Software], [Data] and [Library] [Carpentries] group.

Anyone is welcome: students, university or library personell, research scientists, etc.

#### PS: We are using [Mozilla's Study Group template for this website. They have a `ReadMe`](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup)!
