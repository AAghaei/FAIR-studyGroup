# Follow-up events to the ["FAIR Data and Software"-workshop](https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/) at [TIB, Hannover](https://www.tib.eu)

We meet every **Wednesday** at **16 to 18 o'clock** in the
[**Grunwald-Haus**, ground floor, right besides the entrance](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27870998)
(you may need to knock on the window). We'll be learning from each other and teaching ourselves about:

- the [FAIR Data Principles]
- sustainable software development
- in the context of scientific research, and
- establish a local [Software], [Data] and [Library] [Carpentries] group.

Anyone is welcome: students, university or library personell, research scientists, etc.

## Process for suggesting & announcing events

1. Search the [issue list] whether your topic was presented already.
1. If not, or your idea is significantly different, please [follow Mozilla's guide to add an event][add]. If you feel comfortable to do so, please feel free to skip to step 5 & 6 there and send a Pull Request with your event as a file. Don't worry if you are not sure how this works! The early steps of the guide show you how to send an Issue. We'll teach you Pull Requests if you want.
1. Either way, the issue or PR will be voted upon by interested people and we'll sort it into the schedule once the suggested event has a volunteer to prepare & lead it, and it is reasonably popular.

#### PS: We are using [Mozilla's Study Group template for this website. They have a `ReadMe`][MSG-ReadMe]!
